# AnnotateLab

A lightweight image and video annotation tool built for a 4-person research team. Upload images or videos, extract frames, label each one with an engagement state, and export everything as CSV for machine learning model training.

---

## What Is This?

AnnotateLab is a local-first annotation tool. Each team member runs the app on their own machine. All four people share the same cloud database and storage, so everyone sees the same data in real time.

Think of it as a simplified version of CVAT — without the complexity of tasks, jobs, or project management. Just upload, label, and store.

---

## Who Uses It

| Role | What They Do |
|---|---|
| Annotator (x2) | Upload images and videos, label each one |
| Supervisor (Professor) | View data, check progress, label occasionally |
| Head | View data, export CSV for analysis |

---

## Core Workflow
Login with Google
↓
Upload images or video
↓
Images compressed → uploaded to Cloudinary → saved to Supabase as "pending"
Video → FFmpeg extracts frames → uploaded to Cloudinary → saved to Supabase as "pending"
↓
Go to Annotate page
↓
Label each image: Engaged / Disengaged / Neutral + optional caption
↓
Record saved to Supabase as "complete"
↓
Head opens Data View → filters → exports CSV

  label TEXT CHECK (label IN ('engaged', 'disengaged', 'neutral')),
  caption TEXT,
  labeled_by TEXT,
  labeled_at TIMESTAMPTZ,
  status TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'pending' CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'complete')),
  created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
);

ALTER TABLE annotations ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

CREATE POLICY "Authenticated users can do everything"
ON annotations FOR ALL TO authenticated
USING (true) WITH CHECK (true);
```

## Running the App

You need **3 terminal windows** open:

### Terminal 1 — Backend
```bash
cd annotatelab-backend
npm start
```
You should see:

AnnotateLab Backend running on port 3001
Cloudinary Cloud: your_cloud_name

### Terminal 2 — ngrok (only needed for uploads)
```bash
ngrok http 3001
```
Copy the forwarding URL e.g. `https://abc123.ngrok-free.app`

Create a `vite.config.js` file in the frontend folder:
```js
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import react from '@vitejs/plugin-react'

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [react()],
  server: {
    proxy: {
      '/api': {
        target: 'https://abc123.ngrok-free.app',
        changeOrigin: true,
        headers: {
          'ngrok-skip-browser-warning': 'true'
        }
      }
    }
  }
})
```

### Terminal 3 — Frontend
```bash
cd annotatelab-frontend
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

- Export filtered data as CSV

---

## How Video Frame Extraction Works
User selects video + FPS
↓
Frontend sends to POST /api/upload/video
↓
Backend creates job in memory, responds with jobId immediately
↓
Background: FFmpeg extracts frames at chosen FPS
↓
Each frame uploaded to Cloudinary
↓
Frontend polls GET /api/job/:jobId every 1.5 seconds
↓
When complete → frontend saves all frames to Supabase

Frame count formula:
Frames = FPS selected × Video duration in seconds

Example:
- 5 minute video at 5 FPS = 1,500 frames

---

## Image Compression

Every uploaded image goes through Sharp compression:

| Pass | Max Width | JPEG Quality | Condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | 1280px | 85% | Always |
| 2 | unchanged | 70% | If still >200KB |
| 3 | 1024px | 70% | If still >200KB |

Video frames skip compression — FFmpeg already outputs compressed JPEGs averaging 20-80KB.

---

## Storage Estimates

| Scenario | Avg size | 200K files | Total |
|---|---|---|---|
| Compressed images | ~50KB | 200K | ~10GB |
| Video frames (FFmpeg JPEG) | ~30KB | 200K | ~6GB |
| Mixed | ~40KB | 200K | ~8GB |

Cloudinary free tier: **25GB** — enough for ~200K files. ✅

---

## Networking

The backend runs locally on your machine. For teammates on different networks:

1. Install ngrok: https://ngrok.com
2. Run `ngrok http 3001`
3. Share the forwarding URL with teammates
4. Each teammate creates their own `vite.config.js` with that URL
5. URL changes every ngrok restart on free plan — reshare when needed

**Important:** Only the person running the backend needs ngrok. All other operations (annotating, viewing data, exporting) work without the backend since they talk directly to Supabase.

---

## Common Issues

### npm not recognized on Windows
Switch from PowerShell to Command Prompt, or run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Force
```

### ffmpeg not recognized
Make sure `C:\ffmpeg\bin` is in your PATH and restart the terminal.

### Upload fails with 502 error
- Make sure backend is running: `npm start`
- Make sure ngrok is running: `ngrok http 3001`
- Update `vite.config.js` with the current ngrok URL
- Restart the frontend after updating the config

### Google login not working
- Make sure your Gmail is added as a Test User in Google Cloud Console
- Make sure the callback URL in Google matches your Supabase project URL

### Images not showing after upload
- Check Cloudinary dashboard for uploaded files
- Check Supabase table for new rows
- Check backend terminal for error messages

### Video stuck on extracting
- Make sure FFmpeg is installed correctly
- Check backend terminal for FFmpeg error messages
- Try a smaller video file first

---

## Important Security Notes

- Never commit `.env` files
- Never share your Cloudinary API Secret publicly
- Never share your Supabase service_role key — only the anon key goes to the frontend
- Never share your ngrok auth token publicly
- Keep the GitHub repository private

---

## Team Workflow

### When uploading:
1. Person running backend must have `npm start` running
2. Person running backend must have `ngrok http 3001` running
3. Share ngrok URL with the uploader if they are on a different machine

### When annotating:
- Backend does NOT need to be running
- Just open the frontend and go to Annotate page

### When exporting:
- Backend does NOT need to be running
- Open Data View, apply filters, click Export CSV
